THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SITE!

I am experimenting with Quarto and the new Positron IDE to create a site to hold some biographical information as well as a few data visualizations and personal projects.

I am a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City](https://www.kansascityfed.org/research-staff/alex-gallin/).  I hold a BA in Economics with a minor in Mathematics from Carleton College.
