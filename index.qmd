### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SITE

I am experimenting with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and the new [Positron IDE](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) to create a site to hold some biographical information as well as a few data visualizations and personal projects.

I am a Research Associate at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City](https://www.kansascityfed.org/research).  I hold a BA in Economics with a minor in Mathematics from Carleton College.
